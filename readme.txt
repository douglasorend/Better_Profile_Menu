[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod alters the main menu's Profile menu to add more functionality to the menu itself, similar to what SMF 2.1 release 2.1 did.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on any version of SMF 2.0.x.  SMF 1.x and SMF 2.1 is not and will not be supported.

The [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1264]Drafts[/url], [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=864]Bookmarks[/url] and [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1675]Ultimate Profile[/url] mod are supported if the appropriate source file is found.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Changelog[/u][/size][/b][/color]
The changelog has been removed and can be seen at [url=http://www.xptsp.com/board/index.php?topic=6.msg130#msg130]XPtsp.com[/url].

If you are running [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3901]Lazy Admin Menu[/url], that mod employs the same operations for [b]Sources/Load.php[/b] that this mod does, so it is okay to skip these operations.
