# BETTER PROFILE MENU v2.8

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3904)

--------

## Introduction
This mod alters the main menu's Profile menu to bring all the functionality of the profile area to the main forum's menu bar.

This mod was inspired by tip provided by [snow](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=152526) in [Lazy Admin Menu](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=400767.msg2785613#msg2785613) in order to make it easier for the admin to navigate straight to where they want to go.

The only difference is that this mod built dynamically, so that any changes to the profile menu are shown immediately.

## Security Issue Notice
If you are running either **VERSION 2.0** or **VERSION 2.1**, you are **STRONGLY URGED** to stop using the mod immediately and upgrade to the latest version, which addresses a **MAJOR SECURITY ISSUE** that has been resolved.  All version 1.x and version 2.2+ mods are not affected by this security issue!

## User Settings
Under **Profile** => **Modify Profile** => **Look and Layout**, there is a new option:

-  **Better Profiles Menu setting**

Each user can set it to one of the following:

- **Completely Disabled** => Exactly like this mod isn't installed :p
- **Enabled** => Exactly like this mod before version 2.4.
- **Enabled with NoClick** => Like Enabled, but clicking profile menu item only opens dropdown.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.12, but should work on any version of SMF 2.0.x.  SMF 1.x and SMF 2.1 is not and will not be supported.

Evidentally, there was an error in the **SMF 2.0.11 to 2.0.12** that prevents the forum from properly caching serialized stuff longer than 4096 bytes long.  This update fixes this problem, if it is present in your forum.
